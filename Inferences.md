# 🧠 Higgs Boson Dataset Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

This notebook investigates the classification of Higgs boson signal data using supervised learning models. The goal is to simulate real-world particle physics workflows and build foundational intuition for research environments like CERN, where high-dimensional, noisy datasets are common.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of simulated particle collision events, each labeled as either signal (Higgs boson detected) or background. Features represent kinematic properties derived from particle detectors, such as momentum, energy, and angular distributions.

## 🧪 Models Trained & Evaluation Metrics

| Model            | Accuracy Score | R² Score     | Observations |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree     | 1.0000         | 1.0000       | Perfect fit; likely overfitting due to model simplicity |
| Random Forest     | 0.8208         | 0.9878       | Strong generalization; balances bias-variance tradeoff |
| MLP Classifier    | 0.7344         | 0.7379       | Moderate performance; sensitive to feature scaling and architecture depth |

## 🔍 Key Inferences

- **Decision Tree** achieved perfect scores, indicating overfitting. While useful for interpretability, it lacks robustness for noisy, high-dimensional physics data.
- **Random Forest** emerged as the most reliable model, offering high accuracy and near-perfect R² without overfitting. Its ensemble nature makes it ideal for particle classification tasks where feature interactions are complex.
- **MLP Classifier** showed potential but underperformed relative to tree-based methods. This highlights the need for deeper architectures or feature engineering when applying neural networks to physics datasets.

## 🧠 Research Insights

- The project deepened my understanding of how machine learning can be applied to particle physics, especially in distinguishing signal from background noise.
- It emphasized the importance of model selection, interpretability, and generalization—critical factors in experimental setups like those at CERN.
- The exercise also reinforced the value of ensemble methods in handling uncertainty and variance in detector data.

## 🚀 Preparation for CERN

This notebook served as a microcosm of the challenges faced in high-energy physics research:
- Handling imbalanced and noisy data
- Evaluating models beyond accuracy (e.g., R² for regression-style insights)
- Understanding the physics behind features to guide model tuning

By simulating this workflow, I’ve built a stronger foundation for contributing to CERN’s data-driven research, particularly in signal detection, anomaly classification, and model interpretability.
